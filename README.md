. Frontend 
● The UI should be clean, user-friendly, and responsive. 
● You are free to use any libraries or packages available on the internet. 
● AJAX or Fetch API should be used for event registration (page should not refresh). 
● Animations and UX improvements are encouraged. 


4. Database 
● Users Table (id, name, email, password, role) 
● Events Table (id, title, description, date, venue, available_seats) 
● Bookings Table (id, user_id, event_id, booking_date) 
● Provide a database dump (.sql file) for easy setup.


6. Additional Requirements 
● Form validation (both client-side & server-side). 
● Prevent users from booking the same event multiple times. 
● Implement basic security (SQL injection prevention, XSS protection). 
● Ensure proper database relations between users, events, and bookings. 
● The application should be structured with separate files for configuration, database 
connection, and logic.
